# web-log-dot-net
Web Log and reports for .NET projects (background processes monitor)
## TODO
```
- Allow user to use custom files (CSS, JS, HTML template)
- Clear temp folder after process finish
- Maybe allow user to make public while working with some api like https://ngrok.com/ ?????
- Maybe add header icons for each log row, if yes add awesomefont CDN
```
## How To Use
* Add reference to DLL in your project.
* Add "using" reference in your desired CS or VB file.
* Add app manifest and set administrator privileges (required for mini http server).
* Open port (user selected) on windows/AV firewall.
* As default the log styling is too simple, but you can use your own CSS file.
